# Mozilla Pulse

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/network-pulse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/network-pulse) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/mozilla/network-pulse?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mozillafoundation/network-pulse)

Pulse is a platform that helps the Mozilla Network capture and broadcast its projects and activities. [mozillapulse.org](https://www.mozillapulse.org/featured)

Around the globe, teachers, engineers, activists, and others collaborate to protect and extend the internet as a public resource. They create amazing apps, art, tools, games, and campaigns. Their impact is tremendous, but decentralized and difficult to track, even within the network.

Pulse reveals the network's footprint, it fosters collaboration and amplifies the big wins.

## Contribute

We love contributors, but the team maintaining this project is small and not structured to significantly support new and inexperienced contributors. If there's an unassigned issue that catches your eye, feel free to open a PR for it, but keep in mind our support will be limited. We usually don't have the capacity to walk you through the process of spinning up the project, opening a PR or describing what the solution to the issue could be.

## Development

### Requirements

- `node`
- `npm`

### Setup

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/mozilla/network-pulse.git
$> cd network-pulse
$> npm install
$> npm start
```

### Environments

If you would like to override default environment variables... create a `.env` file on the root directory and set your env vars there. See [environment variables section](https://github.com/mozilla/network-pulse#environment-variables) for details.

There are two files that you can expressly copy depending on your use:

1. `default.env` has all the environment variables needed to run the pulse site without running a local pulse API instance.
2. `default.localhost.env` has all the environment variables needed to run the pulse site in a way that it uses a locally running pulse API instance.

If you need (2), make sure to follow the instructions in the network pulse api README.md that explain how to set up Google Authentication.

### Key scripts to run

#### `npm start`
This starts server in development mode. See [environment variables section](https://github.com/mozilla/network-pulse#environment-variables) for `PORT` number.

#### `npm test`
This starts a few test scripts. Don't forget to run this command and fix errors (if any) before you git push your changes.

##### Fixing linting errors

If `npm test` yields linting errors, you can run `npm run fix` to have the style linters try to automatically fix any linting issues. This should almost always be enough to fix any linting errors.

#### `npm optimize`
This starts a few image optimization scripts.

## Deployment

### Staging

URL: https://network-pulse-staging.herokuapp.com/

Updates to `master` branch automatically triggers staging deployment.

### Production

URL: https://mozillapulse.org

Deployment is done using the Heroku pipeline. Simply click "Promote To Production".

### Review Apps

#### Review App for PRs

Opening a PR will automatically create a Review App in the `network-pulse` pipeline. A slack bot posts credentials and links to Review Apps in to the `mofo-ra-pulse` Slack channel.

*Note:* This only work for Mo-Fo staff: you will need to manually open a Review App on Heroku for PRs opened by external contributors.

#### Review App for branches

You can manually create a review app for any branch pushed to this repo. It's useful if you want to test your code on Heroku without opening a PR yet.

To create one:
- log into Heroku.
- Go to the `network-pulse` pipeline.
- Click on `+ New app` and select the branch you want to use.

The review app slack bot will post a message in the `mofo-ra-pulse` with links and credentials as soon as the review app is ready.

#### Environment variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GITHUB API authentication.
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_RA`: Webhook to `mofo-ra-pulse`.
- `STAGING_SERVER`: Boolean, set this to `True` on the staging server.

Non-secret envs can be added to the `app.json` file. Secrets must be set on Heroku in the `Review Apps` (pipelines' `settings` tab).
